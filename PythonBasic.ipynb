        "1.what is python and why is it popular?\n",
        "  -  Python is high level programming language known for its simple readable syntax which makes it popular for web development ,datascience ,AI, and task automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in python?  \n",
        "  -  A python interpreter is a program that directly execute python code not like compiled language where the entire code convertsinto machine code before execution python is an interpreted language\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - in python predefined keyword are special word that have specific meaning in the language.we can not use them as variable name. Here are some predefined keyword like False ,None,True,breake etc\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   -  No we can't use keyword as variable name beacause kayword are reserved word in python they have special meanings and define the structure of the language like if, for, while, class, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in python refer to whether the value of an object can be changed after it is created. Example of mutable object in python is set,list,dictionary etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   -  Python's designers made lists mutable and tuples immutable on purpose      because each serves a different role in programming. list meant for dynamic collection and we can do add iten,remove item,change values in list. Tuples means fixed collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - \"==\"Checks whether two objects have the same value.It does not care if they are stored in different places in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - \"is\" Checks whether two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "        It compares their memory addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, logical operators are used to combine or compare conditional statements. They return either True or False. there are three logical operator And,OR,NOT.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another.Python provides built-in functions to convert data types such as integers, floats, strings, etc. There are two type casting in python implicit and explicit type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - implicit type casting automatically converts one data type into another without your intervention.\n",
        "    - in explicit type casting we manually convert one data type into another using Python's built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to make decisions in a program. They allow your code to execute different actions based on different conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - It first checks the if condition. If if is True, it runs that block and skips all elif and else.If the if condition is False, Python checks the first elif condition.If that elif is True, it runs that block and stops checking further.You can have multiple elif statements. If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the else block runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - for loop Used when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list,  string, tuple, range, etc.) or know in advance how many times to loop.\n",
        "    - while loop Used when you want to repeat something until a condition becomes false.The number of iterations is not fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - Imagine you want to keep asking the user to enter a positive number. You don't know how many attempts the user will take.So, a while loop is perfect because it runs until a condition is met."
